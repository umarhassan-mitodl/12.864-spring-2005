description: First solution basis vector obtained in solving the Laplace equation
  using the singular value decomposition. This field arises from the need to solve
  practical problems with incomplete, contradictory and erroneous data and is an example
  of an inverse method. (Image courtesy of Prof. Carl Wunsch.)
